A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, and when heating three items double the heating time. Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time. The program then writes out the recommended heating time.

n=int(input())
t=float(input())
print("Enter the number of items")
print("Enter the single item heating time")
c=t+(50/100)*t
d=t+2*t
if (n==2):
    print("The recommended heating time is %.2f"%c)
elif(n==3):
    print("The recommended heating time is %.2f"%c)
else:
    print("Number of items is more")
